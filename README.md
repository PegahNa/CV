## Education

### Makers Academy (April 2023 to July 2023) Software Engineering
During my time at Makers Academy, I immersed myself in the world of software development using the Agile/XP methodology. I gained proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Test-Driven Development (TDD), Model-View-Controller (MVC), and Domain-Driven Design (DDD). These skills helped me write clean, efficient, and scalable code.

I also honed my abilities in Ruby and Rails, as well as JavaScript, allowing me to develop robust and interactive web applications. To ensure the quality of my code, I regularly used testing frameworks such as RSpec and Jasmine, which helped me write reliable and bug-free code.

I worked extensively in a Pair programming environment, where teamwork and communication were essential. Collaborating with other developers allowed me to share knowledge and approaches, and it was often through these interactions that we were able to find the most effective solutions to problems.

Overall, my time at Makers Academy helped me develop into a self-sufficient developer who values best practices and works collaboratively to create high-quality code.

### Code First Girls (May 2023 to Aug 2023) Software Engineering

Scholarship, sponsored by The Travel Corporation
During my participation in the CFG Software Engineering program, I gained expertise in building and integrating APIs and microservices, enabling seamless communication between software systems. 

I also developed a strong understanding of various data structures and libraries, enhancing efficiency in data management and manipulation. Proficiency in object-oriented programming allowed me to create modular and scalable software solutions. Additionally, I mastered recursion programming techniques and linked lists, empowering efficient data traversal and manipulation. 

Advanced debugging skills and the ability to design efficient algorithms ensured robust and error-free software solutions. With proficiency in Python, I utilized its extensive libraries and frameworks for rapid application development. Acquiring knowledge of the MySQL database management system enabled effective storage and retrieval of data in relational databases. Skills in Tableau facilitated insightful data analysis and presentation, while expertise in PowerBi enabled the creation of interactive reports and dashboards for data-driven decision-making.
